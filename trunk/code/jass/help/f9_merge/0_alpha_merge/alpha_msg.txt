Welcome to the very first Monster Master RPG II alpha test!  
\l

The alpha version is a prototype of the basic mechanics and features of the map.  
Thus you may notice things such as incomplete areas, objects which do not work, or even possibly 
game breaking glitches.  The terrain is also quite lacking, something that will be sure to improve over time.  
\l

As an alpha tester, try to be as critical as possible, but also keep note of the features that you like.  
The feedback you give will be invaluable, as it will ultimately influence the development of the MMRPG II project.
\l

Please read the other Optional Quests if you are lost!  For feedback, etc. visit the project thread by googling:
