The circus of Alfonzo ran into trouble on the road, and he is fresh out of performers.  If I perform an act for Alfonzo, I will be able 
to get access to Castle Cazbar, and finally meet with Abu Dhabi, the Prince of Agon.  I will need a party of three monsters 
before returning to Alfonzo.  Monsters are easier to recruit if they are fed plenty of meat before defeating them.
