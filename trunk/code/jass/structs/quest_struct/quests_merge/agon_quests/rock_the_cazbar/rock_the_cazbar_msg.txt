The desert world of Agon is rumored to contain a magical artifact that might restore power to 
the EluDari, the magical barrier protecting the human worlds from the monsters.  Royal Chaplain Ricard 
has suggested that I seek out help from Abu Dhabi, the Prince of Agon, whose seat is Cazbar, the capital.

If fortune holds, Abu Dhabi will be able to point me in the direction of this magical artifact. 
I will then need to recover the artifact, wherever it may be.
