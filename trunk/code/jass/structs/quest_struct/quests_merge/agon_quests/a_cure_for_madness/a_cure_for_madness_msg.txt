I came across a sick old man who has been driven mad.  Apparently the water supplying Kalka has been tainted, 
turning into a vile shade of green.  Whatever is poisoning the water must be down in the sewers.
\l\l
Unfortunately the entrance to the sewers is locked, so I will need to find a way in.    
Perhaps I should head to Cazbar, the seat of the Prince of Agon, and tell him of the suffering of Kalka.    
Once inside the sewers, 
I will try to find the source of the green water.
