Welcome to MMRPG II!  
\l\l
You are an upcoming Monster Master, but before you leave for your journey, you will need 
to get a grasp on the basic mechanics of the map.
\l\l
One of the most important concepts is interaction.  In order to interact with the world and the NPCS, 
simply select your hero and then right click on any object or NPC. This will open up a dialog to 
perform an action or ask a service from an NPC.  Make sure your hero is close to the NPC, about 
the same distance you would use if speaking to an actual person in real life.
\l\l
The tutorial quest will make sure you master interaction, and then you will be off on your epic journey!
