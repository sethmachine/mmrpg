Isaiahs husband recently passed away. Apparently he was a traveling merchant, 
but unfortunately for him, the caravan he traveled with was ambushed by a group of bandits.  
The customs of Agon have it that widows must bury their dead husbands with bundles of desert flowers.  
But, as the desert of Agon is too dangerous these days, Isaiah has asked me to find these flowers for her.

Hopefully this will end her crying and bring the peace that her husband deserves.
