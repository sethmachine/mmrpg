Oh sweet child, you are most kind.  But I fear that these flowers will do no good
unless they are laid aside the burial tomb of my late husband.

I would do it myself, but the desert is too dangerous for a widow such as me. I know I ask much of you,
but would you do me one last favor, and place these flowers on his tombstone?

Many thanks, sweet child. I am almost at peace of mind already, and I know
my husband will find his rest soon enough, once you bring those flowers to his tombstone.
As for its location--it could be anywhere in the desert.
