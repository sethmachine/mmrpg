Oh sweet child, you are so kind to ask. My husband was a traveling merchant by trade,
and when his caravan returned to Kalka, he did not come home.   

//end

The caravan was ambushed by bandits in the desert, as I am told. The attack was brutal
and the desert so fierce the survivors did not have time to bring back the dead, so they were buried
out in the wastes. But my husband was not given proper burial rites.

//end

It is custom for a widow to bury her dead husband with a bundle of rare desert flowers.
But, as it is too dangerous for me to go out and find these flowers, I have not been able to give
my husband the peace he deserves. 

//end

You are brave, child!  Please, do a grieving widow justice and bring back these desert flowers.
