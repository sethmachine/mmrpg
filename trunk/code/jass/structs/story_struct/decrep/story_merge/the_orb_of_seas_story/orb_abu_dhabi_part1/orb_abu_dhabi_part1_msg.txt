Quite a bold request from a circus performer such as yourself.  Nonetheless I will humor you, for the sake of your amusing performance.  
What would a child such as yourself know about magical artifacts?  And what would you need one for, dancer?

A Monster Master?  So those are your monsters...I see.  Well I do not blame you for joining the circus to make some coin.  
And you are from Greatbark.  Still, you are quite young, but so am I.  If there is magic at work, I know of one place you might 
find what you seek.  Our sacred temple to the northwest.  But I see no reason to admit you.  Or let you plunder our treasures.

The EluDari?  So...it needs a new source of power?  I see...  Well, if Greatbark truly wishes for our friendship, you will help 
our people.  Once you have helped Agon, I will gladly allow you to enter our sacred temple.
