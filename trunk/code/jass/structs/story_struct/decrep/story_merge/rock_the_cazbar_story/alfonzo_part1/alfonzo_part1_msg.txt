Hehe hehe hehe.  So you need to get into Castle Cazbar?  We are in the boat kiddo.  His royal highness has not been 
seeing anyone lately.  Brooding about some war.  But I think you will do just nicely, kiddo.  Hows about you join 
my little circus? Hehe hehe.

Well I am sharp out of performers.  Ran into a little trouble on the road.  But I did teach that bandit leader a good lesson hehe.  
So, I think if you perform an act with me, we can get inside the castle.  Hehe hehe.  Just one little act.  The gold, hehe hehe, though 
I will keep.  I get my money and you get inside.  Fair is fair.  Hehe hehe.

Good, good hehe.  For the act, you will need three Monsters.  Come back when you got three pals with you.  
Remember, Monsters love meat!  Feed them treats and they will follow you, hehe hehe.
