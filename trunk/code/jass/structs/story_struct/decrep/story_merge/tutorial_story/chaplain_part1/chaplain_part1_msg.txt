The Kingdom of GreatBark, of course. It seems your memory is a bit damaged. 
You were found in a burning and raided village as one of the few survivors. 
Your family did not survive. You were in training to be a Monster Master.

Yes. Monster Masters tame, breed, and befriend monsters. 
Some use them for war or protection, while others simply enjoy their companionship. 
To complete your training the King must award you the title of Monster Master when you have 
served the kingdom enough. The task you are given is normally left to true Masters, 
but with the civil war...

The EluDari has begun to wane. Its lights have dimmed, 
which has not been seen in thousands of years. 
People fear an invasion. There have been rumors...but nothing serious. 
Several vassal kingdoms have openly rebelled, claiming that our King 
and his subjects are responsible, for losing their faith and tradition. 
With the war all of our Monster Masters are gone, leaving only those such as yourself.

The EluDari is a magical barrier that protects our worlds from the monsters. 
Legends say before it existed, monsters and their fabled Demon Lord masters 
invaded the humanoid worlds, nearly wiping out humanity. Whether such is true, 
the EluDari is a magical artifact housed in our own kingdom of GreatBark. 
It is true that its lights have dimmed, but what could be the cause? I know not. 
But the King believes it needs new magical artifacts to empower it. 
Which leads to your task...

We have detected a powerful source of magical energy from Agon, 
a desert world with fertile oases. Before you begin your journey, 
you will need to collect your things. 
Take a ferry to the Monster Farm to receive your first companion, 
then head to the Item Vault to take your necessary belongings. Your family was not poor, 
and left you a few things that should prove useful. Come back once you have done these things.
