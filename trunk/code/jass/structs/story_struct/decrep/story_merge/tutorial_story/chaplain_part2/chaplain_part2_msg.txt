Excellent. When you journey in Agon, be on your guard. 
It was once known as the Oasis world, 
but reports have surfaced that it has fallen 
on hard times: oases vanished and bandits 
and wild monsters roam freely. Monsters serve those who they deem most powerful, 
and may tempted to join you if you defeat them. 
Giving them meat makes them like you more.

Our enemies will not be in Agon--it is a fringe world, which is why wild monsters roam it, 
and never has it been vassal. That is why the King sends you there--
out of reach of the civil war, but I have no doubt our enemies may 
have their own agents. Still, none will think twice of a young traveler.

Seek out the city of Cazbar, the seat of the Shah of Agon, Abu Dhabi. 
Abu Dhabi young and bold, and hopefully he will be willing to help our cause. 
He may know where to find this magical artifact.

//end

Finally, before you go, remember that the wilds of Agon will be treacherous. 
If you or your monsters should get hurt, you can return to GreatBark and 
I can restore you, or find an inn in Agon to rest in. If a monster should die, 
only my power, or the power of a Priest can bring it back to life. 
With this, I send you off. Good luck and return to GreatBark whenever you may need to!
