All of the code for the mmrpg project, also known as Monster Master Rpg II is the original work of sethmachine@gmail.com, also known as sethmachine on www.hiveworkshop.com, except where indicated (e.g. third party vJASS libraries).  Do not distribute or use this code for any purpose other than learning or curiosity unless you have explicit permission from the developer sethmachine.  

The code of the project is split into two directories:
